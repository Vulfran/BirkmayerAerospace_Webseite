## My offer

### 1. Stabilize – Restore operational capability and secure value streams

I take responsibility in technically critical or organizationally overloaded development and industrialization environments. The objective is to rapidly bring programs, products, or manufacturing operations back into a controlled and predictable state.

**Typical fields of engagement:**:
- Restoration of schedule, quality, and cost control
- Technical resolution of critical product or system issues
- Immediate measures to secure development and production capability
- Reconfiguration of teams, roles, leadership routines, and decision-making paths
- On-the-job capability development of employees
**Value for executive management:**: Minimization of operational risk, avoidance of imminent delivery, quality, or certification issues, and rapid stabilization of business-critical programs.

### 2. Transform – Increase efficiency, robustness, and product quality

I lead transformation initiatives that sustainably enhance the performance of development, industrialization, or manufacturing organizations. This includes technical, organizational, and process-oriented realignment.

**Typical fields of engagement:**:
- Efficiency improvements in development, industrialization, or manufacturing
- Re-engineering of products with high defect rates or field issues
- Introduction of robust, scalable development and industrialization processes
- Optimization of technical decision logic, interfaces, and governance
- Capability development and coaching of technical leaders
**Value for executive management:**: Products become more reliable, development and production processes more predictable and cost-efficient, and the organization gains technical and structural resilience.


### 3. Scale – Systematically expand development and manufacturing capacity

I support companies that need to deliberately align their product development and/or manufacturing for growth, new programs, or higher production volumes.

**Typical fields of engagement:**:

- Establishment of scalable development and industrialization structures
- Preparation for increased volumes, new product generations, or program launches
- Process and tooling architecture for growing technical organizations
- Introduction of control models that combine robustness with speed
- Systematic development of the workforce toward growth-capable teams
**Value for executive management:**: After the engagement, the organization can reliably deliver higher volumes, new products, or more complex programs while remaining controllable, audit-ready, and economically stable.

## Success Stories

Throughout my career, I have been able to carry out numerous successful transformations:

- **Performance Improvement**: From 25% to 100% on-time delivery with simultaneous production increase
- **Cost Reduction**: EUR 50 million savings through process optimization
- **Weight Reduction**: 700 kg weight savings through optimized industrialization
- **Time Savings**: 75% reduction in definition time for safety requirements

## Detailed Project Examples {#projects}

### Aircraft Final Assembly Line Performance Improvement {#project1}

**Aircraft Manufacturer, 100,000 Staff, EUR 70B Revenue**

#### Initial Situation

At the production rate of 64 A330/A340 aircraft per year, on-time delivery had been at 25% for an extended period. The company-wide continuous improvement program (CIP) did not bring the expected improvement. The root cause was not clear. The following year, the production rate was to be scaled to 74 aircraft per year.

#### Tasks

- Improve on-time delivery from 25% to 100%
- Identify causes, define measures and drive implementation
- Support the head of the final assembly line and represent him in relevant boards (Airbus-wide)
- Overcome organizational and intercultural hurdles in an international environment

#### Implemented Measures

**Identification of the most significant causes:**
- Erroneous mounting points for buyer-furnished equipment
- Damages to aircraft structure, floor panels, cabin furnishing
- High level of equipment claims with no-fault-found

**Improvement measures:**
- Multiple correction of the mounting point installation tool
- Correction of quality issues in a supplying plant
- Introduction of protective measures for cabin installation and furnishing; improved transportation means
- Tailored support during equipment installation; improved allocation of equipment protective devices

#### Achievements

- ✅ **100% on-time delivery** achieved after 10 months with parallel production rate scaling from 64→74 aircraft/year
- ✅ **Reduction of production-related quality issues and claims by up to 75%**
