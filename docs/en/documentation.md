## Detailed Project Examples {#projects}

### Aircraft Final Assembly Line Performance Improvement {#project1}

**Aircraft Manufacturer, 100,000 Staff, EUR 70B Revenue**

#### Initial Situation

At the production rate of 64 A330/A340 aircraft per year, on-time delivery had been at 25% for an extended period. The company-wide continuous improvement program (CIP) did not bring the expected improvement. The root cause was not clear. The following year, the production rate was to be scaled to 74 aircraft per year.

#### Tasks

- Improve on-time delivery from 25% to 100%
- Identify causes, define measures and drive implementation
- Support the head of the final assembly line and represent him in relevant boards (Airbus-wide)
- Overcome organizational and intercultural hurdles in an international environment

#### Implemented Measures

**Identification of the most significant causes:**
- Erroneous mounting points for buyer-furnished equipment
- Damages to aircraft structure, floor panels, cabin furnishing
- High level of equipment claims with no-fault-found

**Improvement measures:**
- Multiple correction of the mounting point installation tool
- Correction of quality issues in a supplying plant
- Introduction of protective measures for cabin installation and furnishing; improved transportation means
- Tailored support during equipment installation; improved allocation of equipment protective devices

#### Achievements

- ✅ **100% on-time delivery** achieved after 10 months with parallel production rate scaling from 64→74 aircraft/year
- ✅ **Reduction of production-related quality issues and claims by up to 75%**

### Competence Development for Safety-Critical Systems {#project2}

**Industrial Corporation, 350,000 Staff, EUR 76B Revenue**

#### Initial Situation

A leading industrial group developing hybrid-electric propulsion needed to progress from concept to certifiable product under stringent aviation safety requirements, with a team inexperienced in safety-critical systems. All development activities were to be integrated into the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) System Polarion.

#### Tasks

- Build Safety Culture
- Define Strategic Roadmap
- Integrate Safety Process into the ALM-System

#### Implemented Measures

- Strategic Roadmap developed to build key competencies including those for system safety
- The Safety-Function is organized centrally with the System Architecture team
- The Safety-Process is integrated into the ALM-System
- An open and strong network has been built between the safety experts and the development teams to foster the safety culture
- A catalogue with key design requirements for safety is established in coordination with the development teams

#### Achievements

- ✅ **Lead time to define key safety requirements reduced by 75%**
- ✅ **Substantially de-risked certification**
- ✅ **Accelerated market entry** of groundbreaking technology

### Strategic Reorientation of the Engineering Organization {#project3}

**Aircraft Manufacturer, 100,000 Staff, EUR 70B Revenue**

#### Initial Situation

The Engineering organization with national Engineering Integration Centers needed to be organized more effectively for new developments. The current Engineering organization was capable of managing aircraft modifications of existing aircraft types, however, the organization could not be scaled for rapid growth with new aircraft developments running in parallel.

#### Tasks

- Define new engineering organization with a strategically new orientation for several aircraft development programs running in parallel
- Define internationally harmonized processes for the HR and Finance organizations
- Propose more efficient setup of the Program and Sales organizations

#### Implemented Measures

As senior manager for organizational development:
- Strategically designed a new engineering structure by engaging the most senior engineering stakeholders
- Designed harmonized HR and Finance processes by engaging the most senior stakeholders
- Analyzed the current Program and Sales organizations and the existing cooperation
- Redefined the interfaces between the program and sales organizations

#### Achievements

- ✅ **Enabled scalable growth** for the development of two additional aircraft types (A400M, A350) in the following 10 years
- ✅ **Established internationally harmonized processes** for HR and finance organizations
- ✅ **Defined efficient cross-functional way of working** between Program and Sales without organization change
