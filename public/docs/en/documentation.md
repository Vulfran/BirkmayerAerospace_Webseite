## Detailed Project Examples {#projects}

### Aircraft Final Assembly Line Performance Improvement {#project1}

**Aircraft Manufacturer, 100,000 Staff, EUR 70B Revenue**

#### Initial Situation

At the production rate of 64 A330/A340 aircraft per year, on-time delivery had been at 25% for an extended period. The company-wide continuous improvement program (CIP) did not bring the expected improvement. The root cause was not clear. The following year, the production rate was to be scaled to 74 aircraft per year.

#### Tasks

- Improve on-time delivery from 25% to 100%
- Identify causes, define measures and drive implementation
- Support the head of the final assembly line and represent him in relevant boards (Airbus-wide)
- Overcome organizational and intercultural hurdles in an international environment

#### Implemented Measures

**Identification of the Most Significant Causes:**
- Erroneous mounting points for buyer-furnished equipment

### Aircraft Systems Procurement Reorientation {#project5}

**Aircraft Manufacturer, 100,000 Staff, EUR 70B Revenue**

#### Initial Situation

The client had experience in the procurement of aircraft systems equipment (for flight control, landing gear, electrical system, ...).  The equipment manufacturers were involved late in the development phase when the equipment specification was defined.  At this time, it was too late to consider solutions with new technologies that have an impact on aircraft design. To be able to consider advantageously the most modern technologies, which had been tested by suppliers in the full system context it was decided to no longer procure separate equipment separately, but as a set of complete systems with aligned technologies.  To align the aircraft design optimally to the new technologies, the system suppliers were to be involved early in a „Joint Development Phase“ or in „Early Supplier Involvement“.  It was not clear how to proceed with system suppliers.  It was not clear how to identify capable system suppliers that contribute constructively in a „Joint Development Phase“ or in „Early Supplier Involvement“.

#### Tasks

Define the technical part of the procurement of complete systems
- Define the System Specification that is adequate for the Joint Development Phase or Early Supplier Involvement.
- Define method how to identify system suppliers that have the required system competences
- Define method how to evaluate the development capability of suppliers for systems and equipment

#### Implemented Measures

- Define the guideline for the system specifications (Top Level System Requirement Document and High-Level System Requirement Document)
- Define guideline to identify system suppliers with adequate system competences
- Define training for system developers on how to work with system suppliers (Airbus Award)
- Support system suppliers during the „Joint Development Phase“ or „Early Supplier Involvement “


#### Achievements

- ✅ **For the A350 all aircraft systems were procured with „System contracts“**
