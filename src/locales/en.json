    "title": "Experienced Interim executive for Product Development & Engineering",
    "text": "As an interim executive, I support companies in stabilizing, transforming, and scaling the development and series production of their products, as well as their operational safety and reliability - drawing on solid aerospace expertise and international leadership experience at Airbus and Rolls-Royce in engineering, systems development, and project management. I am specialized in agile transformation, process optimization, change management, crisis resolution, and building high-performance teams. With my strategic mindset, deep technical expertise, and as a strong communicator I combine leadership excellence with engineering depth and transformation skills, even in higly relgulated industries. The result: reliable, safe, and defect-free products - with shorter time-to-market, lower product and service costs, and higher customer satisfaction."

      "title": "Aircraft Final Assembly Line Performance Improvement",
      "subtitle": "Aircraft Manufacturer, 100.000 Staff, EUR 70B Revenue",
      "text": "Clients Initial Situation: At the production rate of 64 A330/A340 aircraft per year the on-time delivery was already for an extended period at 25%.  The company-wide continuous improvement program (CIP) did not bring the expected improvement.  The root-case was not clear.  The following year the production rate shall be scaled to 74 aircraft per year. Tasks:   * Improve the on-time-delivery from 25% to 100% * Identify causes, define measures and drive implementation * Support the head of the final assembly line and represent him in relevant boards (Airbus wide) * Overcome organizational and intercultural hurdles in an international environment Implemented Measures: * Identification of the most significant causes for the significant delays in the final assembly process ** Erroneous mounting points for the buyer furnished equipment  ** Damages to the aircraft structure, floor panels, cabin furnishing  ** High level of equipment claims with no-fault-found * Identification and implementation of improvement measures  ** Multiple correction of the mounting point installation tool ** Correction of quality issues in a supplying plant ** Introduction of protective measures for cabin installation and furnishing; improved transportation means ** Tailored support during equipment installation, improved allocation of equipment protective devices Achievements: * 100% on-time-delivery achieved after 10 months with parallel production rate scaling from 64->74 aircraft/year * Reduction of production related quality issues and claims by up to 75%",
