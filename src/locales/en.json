    "title": "Experienced Interim executive for Product Development & Engineering",
    "text": "As an interim executive, I support companies in stabilizing, transforming, and scaling the development and series production of their products, as well as their operational safety and reliability - drawing on solid aerospace expertise and international leadership experience at Airbus and Rolls-Royce in engineering, systems development, and project management. I am specialized in agile transformation, process optimization, change management, crisis resolution, and building high-performance teams. With my strategic mindset, deep technical expertise, and as a strong communicator I combine leadership excellence with engineering depth and transformation skills, even in higly relgulated industries. The result: reliable, safe, and defect-free products - with shorter time-to-market, lower product and service costs, and higher customer satisfaction."

      "title": "Aircraft Final Assembly Line Performance Improvement",
      "subtitle": "Aircraft Manufacturer, 100.000 Staff, EUR 70B Revenue",
      "text": "Clients Initial Situation: At the production rate of 64 A330/A340 aircraft per year the on-time delivery was already for an extended period at 25%.  The company-wide continuous improvement program (CIP) did not bring the expected improvement.  The root-case was not clear.  The following year the production rate shall be scaled to 74 aircraft per year. Tasks:   * Improve the on-time-delivery from 25% to 100% * Identify causes, define measures and drive implementation * Support the head of the final assembly line and represent him in relevant boards (Airbus wide) * Overcome organizational and intercultural hurdles in an international environment Implemented Measures: * Identification of the most significant causes for the significant delays in the final assembly process ** Erroneous mounting points for the buyer furnished equipment  ** Damages to the aircraft structure, floor panels, cabin furnishing  ** High level of equipment claims with no-fault-found * Identification and implementation of improvement measures  ** Multiple correction of the mounting point installation tool ** Correction of quality issues in a supplying plant ** Introduction of protective measures for cabin installation and furnishing; improved transportation means ** Tailored support during equipment installation, improved allocation of equipment protective devices Achievements: * 100% on-time-delivery achieved after 10 months with parallel production rate scaling from 64->74 aircraft/year * Reduction of production related quality issues and claims by up to 75%",

      "text": "Clients Initial Situation: A leading industrial group developing hybrid-electric propulsion needed to progress from concept to certifiable product under stringent aviation safety requirements, with a team inexperienced in safety-critical systems.  All development activities shall be integrated into the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) System Polarion. Tasks: * Build Safety Culture * Define Strategic Roadmap * Integrate Safety Process into the ALM-System Implemented Measures: * Strategic Roadmap developed to build key competences including those for system safety * The Safety-Function is organized centrally with the System Architecture team * The Safety-Process in integrated into the ALM-System * An open and strong network has been built between the safety experts and the development teams to foster the safety culture.  This safety culture is built on a clear explanation of the safety requirements and open discussion of the proposals from the development teams  * A catalogue with key design requirements for safety is established in coordination with the development teams Achievements: The lead time to define the key safety requirements was reduced by 75%, substantially de-risking certification and accelerating the market entry of this groundbreaking technology.",

      "subtitle": "Aircraft Manufacturer, 100.000 Staff, EUR 70B Revenue",
      "text": "Clients Initial Situation: <br>The Engineering organization with the national Engineering Integration Centers for the relevant aircraft contribution wing, forward fuselage, center-wing box, rear fuselage, cabin systems, propulsion, shall be organized more effectively, for new developments. The current Engineering-organization is capable to manage and design aircraft modifications of the exiting aircraft types, however, the organization cannot be scaled for rapid growth with new aircraft developments that run in parallel. <br>Post Merger Integration the HR and Finance organizations still work differently in the national organizations.  A harmonized process shall be established. <br>The way-of-working between the Program and Sales organizations was very inefficient and led to delays. <br>Tasks: <br>* Define new engineering organization with a strategically new orientation with several new aircraft development programs running in parallel. <br>* Define internationally harmonized processes for the HR and Finance organizations <br>* Strategic Reorientation of the Engineering Organization und Post Merger Integration of the Finance, HR, Program- and Sales organizations <br>Implemented Measures: <br>As senior manager for organizational development within the executive HR organization I <br>* strategically designed a new engineering structure by engaging the most senior engineering stakeholders <br>* designed harmonized HR and Finance processes by engaging the most senior HR and Finance stakeholders und the heads of the international Expert groups <br>* analyzed the current Program and Sales organizations and the existing cooperation between organizations. <br>* redefined the interfaces between the program and sales organizations and steered the cross-functional way-of-working. Achievements: * Enabled scalable growth for the development of two additional aircraft types (A400M, A350) in the following 10 years. * Established internationally harmonized processes for the HR and finance organizations. * Defined and efficient and cross-functional way of working between Program and Sales organization without an organization change.",
